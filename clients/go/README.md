# Apiban Clients #

**APIBAN is made possible by the generosity of our [sponsors](https://apiban.org/doc.html#sponsors).**

## Using the GO executable ##

You can build the client using go, or just use the pre-built executable: (for Raspberry Pi users, there's a compiled executable in the release assets or see below for building on a Pi)

### Quick and Easy Install Instructions ###

1. Create the folder `/usr/local/bin/apiban`
  
  ```shell 
  mkdir /usr/local/bin/apiban 
  ```
2. Download apiban-iptables-client to `/usr/local/bin/apiban/`
    
```shell 
cd /usr/local/bin/apiban 
   
```
   
```shell 
wget https://github.com/palner/apiban/raw/v0.7.0/clients/go/apiban-iptables-client
   
```
   
3. Download `config.json` to `/usr/local/bin/apiban/`
```shell
cd /usr/local/bin/apiban

```
```shell

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/palner/apiban/v0.7.0/clients/go/apiban-iptables/config.json

```
4. Using your favorite text editor, update `config.json` with your APIBAN key, for e.g:

```shell

vi config.json

```

6. Give apiban-iptables-client execute permission

```shell
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/apiban/apiban-iptables-client

```
7. Test

```shell 

./usr/local/bin/apiban/apiban-iptables-client 

```

### Notes ###

**If upgrading from an older version, please add "FLUSH":"200" to your config.json.**

## Logs ##

Log output is saved to `/var/log/apiban-client.log`. 

### Log Rotation ###

Want to rotate the log? Here's an example...

```bash
cat > /etc/logrotate.d/apiban-client << EOF
/var/log/apiban-client.log {
        daily
        copytruncate
        rotate 7
        compress
}
EOF
```
## Automation ##
### Cron ###
Example crontab running every 4 min...

```bash
# update apiban iptables
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
*/4 * * * * /usr/local/bin/apiban/apiban-iptables-client >/dev/null 2>&1
```
### systemd ###

See the [systemd](systemd/) directory for example systemd units.

## Building on Raspbian Buster ##

Since the version of `go` that's in Buster is too old to build `apiban-iptables-client`, here's a simple workaround for `go`.

```
cd /usr/local/src
wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.14.7.linux-armv6l.tar.gz
tar -xzvf go1.14.7.linux-armv6l.tar.gz
ln -sfn /usr/local/src/go/bin/go /usr/bin/go
```

Then building of `apiban-iptables-client` is now possible.

```
cd /usr/local/src
git clone https://github.com/palner/apiban
cd apiban/clients/go/apiban-iptables
go build apiban-iptables-client.go
```

## How it works ##

The client pulls the API key and last known ID from the **config.json** file.

When executed, the client first checks to see if the **APIBAN** chain exists in iptables. If the chain does not exist, the APIBAN chain is recreated and the **LKID** is reset (allowing a full dump).

IP addresses are added to APIBAN chain and actions are logged in **apiban-client.log**.

By using the last known ID (LKID), only new addresses are pulled (if any); making the process incredibly more efficient. The client will not add duplicate addresses and a full download can be run manually by adding `FULL` as a command line argument (example: `./usr/local/bin/apiban-iptables-client FULL`). The FULL option is great should the system (or iptables) have been restarted.
